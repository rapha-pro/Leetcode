If you hear “minimum steps / shortest / fewest moves / minimum time” → BFS
If you hear “how many groups / islands / components / reachable” → DFS or BFS
If you hear “prerequisites / ordering / can finish courses” → Topological sort (we’ll do after you’re solid on BFS/DFS)


A minimal “graph toolkit” to practice (high ROI list)
Do these in order. In Python. Timed but not rushed.

1) **Number of Islands** (DFS/BFS on grid)
2) **Flood Fill** (DFS/BFS on grid)
3) **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** (BFS; same idea)
4) **Course Schedule** (topological sort) *optional but great*
5) **Shortest Path in Binary Matrix** or **Rotting Oranges** (BFS “minutes/steps”)

If you only have time for 3: do **Islands + Rotting Oranges + Course Schedule**.
